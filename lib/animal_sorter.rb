# Build a class AnimalSorter

# Make sure there are two constants that AnimalSorter knows about, 
# SEA_ANIMALS and LAND_ANIMALS

# AnimalSorter should be able to accept an array of animals on 
# initialization.

# Define a to_a method to account for the species in the test suite.

# Return an array that contains two arrays, the first one
# should include the sea creatures, the second, land animals.

# Read the test suite for an example of a nested array.
