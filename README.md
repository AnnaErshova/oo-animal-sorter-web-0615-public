# Animal Sorter

## Description

You will be writing a class, `AnimalSorter` that, well, sorts a list of animals. It should
take a list of animals on initialization, and instances should respond to a `.to_a` method.

## Instructions

Run the test suite with the `rspec` command.

Implement an "AnimalSorter" class that makes the tests pass.

Your program can have a pre-existing list of animal classifications.
